                    interiority,
                    where consciousness has been methodically replaced by algorithmic suggestion and dopamine-driven
                    compliance.</p>
                <p>The digital landscape didn't just distract you—it surgically removed your capacity for genuine
                    meaning.
                    Every notification, every like, every scroll was another spoonful of your soul scooped out and
                    replaced with
                    prefabricated desire. You're not a person anymore; you're a collection of consumer preferences

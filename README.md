## 📖 Overview

The Dead Circuit is an artistic project exploring themes of digital consciousness erosion, attention economy exploitation, and the hollowing of human purpose in the algorithmic age. This platform serves as both a critique of modern digital life and a manifesto for reclaiming human agency.

## 🌑 Project Philosophy

The circuit is dead, but we are not. This project examines how:

- Human attention has been commodified into the "attention economy"
- Digital platforms create addictive feedback loops that hollow out consciousness
- Algorithmic content consumption replaces authentic human experience
- We can reclaim our minds from digital hijacking
